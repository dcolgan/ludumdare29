monster shoots fireballs at you from behind
you hit the space key to switch between looking up or down

rocks or branches that are still spheres collisionwise are coming up from below, but they are close to each other, so they look like rods or something

hitting rocks or the walls slow you down, and fireballs slam you into the wall also but give you a speed boost?
