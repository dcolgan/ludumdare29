falling down with the camera looking behind you

being chased falling down

you are falling down a giant hole
something is chasing you for some reason
you have health, go as long as you can without dying
you have to avoid small falling debris (does small damage)
maybe you can use rocks to hit the thing following you
you are falling, you can look in 360 degrees around you,
you can throw stuff upwards, and that slows down the thing
maybe you don't have health, you just slow down if you hit something,
the harder you get hit, the more you slow down,
you could knock the thing back more or less depending on how hard you hit it
